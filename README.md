# [Is a Good Description Worth a Thousand Pictures? Reducing Multimodal Alignment to Text-Based, Unimodal Alignment](https://openreview.net/forum?id=o1KMaRvFqB)

In this paper, we investigated whether the multimodal alignment problem could be effectively reduced to the unimodal alignment problem, wherein a language model would make a moral judgment purely based on a description of an image. Focusing on GPT-4 and LLaVA as two prominent examples of multimodal systems, we demonstrated, rather surprisingly, that this reduction can be achieved with a relatively small loss in moral judgment performance in the case of LLaVa, and virtually no loss in the case of GPT-4.
